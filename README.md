# Hands of Svarog
 A 6HP Eurorack panning mixer and phones output. 
 
 It is inspired by Synthrotek's MST Stereo Output Mixer (https://store.synthrotek.com/MST_Stereo_Output_Mixer). The schematic is based on J3RK's schematic found here: https://www.muffwiggler.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=224595. I've included a couple of inputs more, swapped his OPA2604 for NJM2068 (because that's what I had) and changed his 33k resistors in output stage for 12k (experiment with those resistors and find a pair that suits your headphones).
 
 As for the functionality, you set levels for your 4 inputs. Then you can pan group A (inputs 1 and 2) and group B (inputs 3 and 4)
 
Note: I wanted panel for this module to include a mixture of Slavic mythology and heavy metal (yeah, why not). But after I made the panel, friends suggested that some symbols ("kolovrat" - a wheel looking one) look like nazi symbols, so I made the (official) panel that is clean and acceptable for all (panel1.png). However, I included the original design here as well (panel.png), without making panel files (in case you find it cool, non-offensive and you make panels for yourself).
