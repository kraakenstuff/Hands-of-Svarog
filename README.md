 A 6HP Eurorack panning mixer and phones output. 
 
 It is inspired by Synthrotek's MST Stereo Output Mixer (https://store.synthrotek.com/MST_Stereo_Output_Mixer). The schematic is based on J3RK's schematic found here: https://www.muffwiggler.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=224595. I've included a couple of inputs more, swapped his OPA2604 for NJM2068 (because that's what I had) and changed his 33k resistors in output stage for 12k (experiment with those resistors and find a pair that suits your headphones).
 
 As for the functionality, you set levels for your 4 inputs. Then you can pan group A (inputs 1 and 2) and group B (inputs 3 and 4)
